Usage:  ./mu install DIR NAME 

    Install a proxy to this script at DIR/NAME

    This is the only way of using this command directly. It must
    be called precisely as indicated from within its own directory.

    Installed proxy files (usually placed somewhere on the $PATH) 
    call the ./mu script with its full pathname after setting its
    own environment variables for ./mu to use.

Example: ./mu install /usr/local/bin foo                     
                                                      
    $ ./mu install /usr/local/bin foo
    $ cat /usr/local/bin/foo
    export mu_cmdname=foo
    export mu_cmdpath=/usr/local/bin/foo
    export mu_cmddest=/full/path/to/mu
    /full/path/to/mu $*
    $ foo marco
    polo
    $
    $ ./mu install ~/bin/bar
    $ bar marco
    polo
    $ foo marco
    polo
